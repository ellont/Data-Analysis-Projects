This project is a research-based data analysis endeavor focusing on the development, evaluation, and critical assessment of machine learning models. Its primary goal is to identify patient sentiment towards clinicians using online reviews from ratemds.com, a United States clinician review website. I have access to a dataset of clinician reviews, each labeled with a sentiment classification indicating whether a patient was satisfied or dissatisfied with their interaction with a clinician. This dataset includes various feature representations of patient comments, such as raw data, TFIDF, and word embeddings. Ground truth labels for both training and validation sets are also provided.

My comprehension of the machine learning models applied in this study is detailed in a research report. This report comprehensively covers the methods used and the findings obtained. It also critically discusses the knowledge gained from this open-ended research project, offering insights into the effectiveness and limitations of the applied models.
